# README Generator

README Generator

## Description

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. This project is to use node.js and Javascript to autogenerate a readme file for the user once they input / answer the questions.

## Usage

For this task, we were provided star code to manipulate and then in the Javascripts and the markdown file provided was manipulated! First I had to create a gitignore file and DS_store file to make sure that the node_module folder is not uploaded to the repo. Then I had to create an array of questions for user to input. Form there, we create a function to write README file and then created a function to initialize app and then call it. In the Markdown file, From there I created a function that returns a license badge based on which license is passed in. The last thing we had to do was add Include packages needed for this application and reocrd it.
